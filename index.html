            <p>With this platform you can also develop skills such as competitive coding,web development,android development etc. These are Some<br>
                common skills that are not field specific and everyone should learn them. We will have field specific skills also in our future plans.
            </p><h2>COMPETITIVE CODING</h2><br>
            you can learn all about from any of the following links<br>
